# Tim Rowe - Github projects

- Welcome to the updated github home.  Here you'll find mostly a lot of utility projects and libraries intended to be included with other work.  Most personal/opensource projects you'll currently find here are Node/Typescript/React of some flavour.  You'll also find a heap of utility Docker containers and Github actions.

Some current in-flight projects:

- [user-session-middleware](https://github.com/tjsr/user-session-middleware) - session handling and user authentication middleware for microservices, intended for rapid user-accessible API scaffolding. Collioqually 'USM'.
- [tagtool](https://github.com/tjsr/tagtool) - USM-based data tagging microservice for embedding in to applications.
- [pinpanion](https://github.com/tjsr/pinpanion) - A Pinny Arcade pin collection tool.  Uses TS/React/MaterialUI/Vite.
- [node-patched-npm](https://github.com/tjsr/node_patched_npm) - A patched node/alpine container with recent vulnerability fixes including npm fixes.
- [simple-env-utils](https://github.com/tjsr/simple-env-utils) - simple methods for ensuring compliant environment variables.
- [mysql-pool-utils](https://github.com/tjsr/mysql-pool-utils) - simple re-usable database connection pool handling functions.
- [@tjsr/remote_docker_stop](https://github.com/tjsr/remote_docker_stop) - Github action to stop a remote docker container over SSH
- [@tjsr/remote_docker_pull](https://github.com/tjsr/remote_docker_pull) - Github action to pull a remote docker image over SSH
- [sparse-bit-string](https://github.com/tjsr/sparse-bit-string) - A packed, compressed bit flag suite suitable for including in URLs and QR codes where data limits are factors.
- [absee](https://github.com/tjsr/absee) - A/B See.  An A/B testing tool that allows users to compare and select from presented elements or sets.
- [eslint-config](https://github.com/tjsr/eslint-config) - Shared typescript-eslint rules and configuration for use across all TS projects.

## Early WIP projects

- [prisma-generic](https://github.com/tjsr/prisma-generic) - A generic prisma container that enables launching with a mounted folder of prisma configs to reduce the need for repeatedly re-building the same base prisma deployment helper container. Intended for use with mysql-pool-utils based microservices.
- [dyn53](https://github.com/tjsr/dyn53) - An AWS Cloudformation/Route53/Lambda project to host and manage DynDNS entries and updating.
- [abswipe](https://github.com/tjsr/abswipe) - A React swipy control for A/B element selection.
- [github_node_repo_dep](https://github.com/tjsr/github_node_repo_dep) - A set of github actions which scan for other repos that use this (or a specified) artifact, allowing you to automatically run actions against them (such as open a PR or clone/test them).  Useful for immediately testing libraries against branches by cloning both repos and testing using `npm link`.

## TODO projects

Stuff I want to get around to but haven't had the time.

- ExpressServerHelper - An incredibly quick wrapper for common basic Express server scaffolding and plugins - currently lives within `tagtool` and to be split out to its own project for re-use.
- grt - Github Repo Tool.  Simple commandline tool using @clack/prompts for updating github repository properties and settings that aren't available from the Gihub CLI except using complex queries or GraphQL.
- @tjsr/ts-base - A two-way project template, for basing new projects on with a commandline selector, which also allows syncing back to other projects and rebasing to keep all small projects and microservices in sync.
- npm ldlink - 'local dev link' command for use with npm - scans all global node_modules for use of symlinks or junctions, and, based on config, links all local usages to use the node_module globally linked project. Intended for future addition to npm core.
- [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob), [rimraf](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf), [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) and [pacote](https://github.com/npm/pacote) updates. Updates to core npm/node libraries to use latest versions, and ensure support with nodejs20/22. Requires some significant work and fixes to timout issues in [tapjs](https://github.com/tapjs/tapjs).
- LWDB - croudsourced data collection tool for the Last War mobile game to help players plan and determine durations and costs of upgrades.

## Older projects

Most of my older projects are hosted on bitbucket at [bitbucket.org/tjsrowe](https://bitbucket.org/tjsrowe).  Predominantly these ones are utilities for helping the cycling/mountain bike community.  They also tend to use Bitbucket pipelines and self-hosted runners.
