- 👋 Hi, I’m @tjsr
- 👀 Most of my code you will instead find on bitbucket.org/tjsrowe.  My open-source projects are predominantly utilities to help the cycling/mountain bike community.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript and Golang
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not sure.  I'm already very busy.
- 📫 Find me at insta @tjsr.id.au (for chocolate creatioons), twitter @tjsr (for general 'old man shakes fist at cloud' stuff), or email to tim@tjsr.id.au
